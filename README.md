# quadraticEquationsAnalyzer
This program determines the type of equation, finds the real and imaginary roots (solutions), analyzes the discriminant, determines the number of real or imaginary solutions and graphs the equation (solution graph). It also solves for the coefficient a = 0, in a first degree equation of one variable, it also solves for a = b = 0.

**The program uses GNUPlot to graph the quadratic equations**
The program runs through the GNU/Linux console
